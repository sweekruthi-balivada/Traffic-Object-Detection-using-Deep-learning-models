FasterRCNN, Yolov8, Pytorch<br>

<b>Custom Model - FasterRCNN</b><br>
The Faster R-CNN model was chosen for its state-of-the-art performance in accuracy and speed, making it ideal for real-time applications. Its two-stage architecture, consisting of a Region Proposal Network (RPN) and a detection network, allows for precise localization of objects. The model was customized by integrating a specific backbone and training with a tailored optimizer and learning rate scheduler. This custom setup was used to experiment and enhance performance further.<br>

<b>YOLO v8</b><br>
YOLOv8, sourced from Ultralytics, was trained for object detection tasks with a focus on efficiency and real-time performance. The model was trained over 15 epochs with specific parameters and metrics tracked throughout the training process. Various visualizations and performance metrics were monitored to ensure effective training and validation.

<b>Comparison</b><br>
Both models were thoroughly evaluated, with FasterRCNN offering more flexibility and experimentation opportunities, while YOLOv8 provided faster inference times and efficient real-time detection. Ultimately, YOLOv8 demonstrated better overall performance in terms of speed and precision.
